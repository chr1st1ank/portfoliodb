# Developer Instructions

## Architecture

Check out docs/architecture.md for a high-level overview of the architecture.

## Backend

Adding dependencies for the Python backend:

```shell
cd backend && uv add <package> 
```

The project uses taskfile.dev for tasks:

```shell
❯ task
task: Available tasks for this project:
* makemigrations:       Make Django DB migrations
* real-data:            Load real data into DB
* sample-data:          Load sample data into DB
* start-backend:        Start Django backend server
* start-frontend:       Start Vite frontend development server
* test:                 Run frontend tests with Vitest
```

## Frontend

### General Code Style & Formatting

- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Follow Expo's official documentation for setting up and configuring projects.

### Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

### TypeScript Best Practices

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid any and enums; use explicit types and maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Enable strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.

### Syntax & Formatting

- Use the function keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.

### Styling & UI

- Use Expo's built-in components for common UI patterns and layouts.
- Implement responsive design with Flexbox and useWindowDimensions.
- Use styled-components or Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Implement dark mode support using Expo's useColorScheme.
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props.
- Use react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for performant animations and gestures.

### Specials

The React Grid component is used as follows:

```ts
<Grid container spacing={2}>
  <Grid size={{ xs: 6, md: 8 }}>
    <Item>xs=6 md=8</Item>
  </Grid>
  <Grid size={{ xs: 6, md: 4 }}>
    <Item>xs=6 md=4</Item>
  </Grid>
  <Grid size={{ xs: 6, md: 4 }}>
    <Item>xs=6 md=4</Item>
  </Grid>
  <Grid size={{ xs: 6, md: 8 }}>
    <Item>xs=6 md=8</Item>
  </Grid>
</Grid>
```
